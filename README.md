# NCCL Extensions

NCCL Extensions is a repository of communication patterns for AI use cases,
built on top of NCCL device and host APIs. It speeds up tensor communication
for workloads like MoE token shuffle and reinforcement learning weight rollout.

This is an evolving space, and the content here is under constant development
and subject to change. We will continue exploring it and welcome your
contributions.

## What's Inside

### [`nccl_ep/`](nccl_ep/) — Expert Parallelism
Optimized dispatch and combine primitives for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) token
routing, built on NCCL's Device API (LSA and GIN operations).

### [`nccl_m2n/`](nccl_m2n/) — Mesh-to-Mesh Rollout
Experimental library for resharding a tensor between two disjoint groups of
GPU processes (e.g. trainer and inference ranks) in a single, zero-copy call,
built on NCCL's window API.

### [`python/`](python/) — Python bindings
Python package (`nccl-extensions`) providing Pythonic wrappers for `nccl_ep`
and `nccl_m2n` as `nccl.ep` and `nccl.m2n`. See
[`python/README.md`](python/README.md) for details.

## Installation

Prebuilt Python wheels are available from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nccl-extensions/) for Linux on x86-64 and
aarch64, with CPython 3.10 through 3.14.

Choose the extra matching your CUDA major version:

```bash
# CUDA 12
python -m pip install "nccl-extensions[cu12]"

# CUDA 13
python -m pip install "nccl-extensions[cu13]"
```

The CUDA extras are mutually exclusive. Each extra installs the corresponding
CUDA runtime dependencies and **exactly NCCL 2.30.7**. Other NCCL versions have
not yet been validated and are not guaranteed to work.

NCCL EP compiles kernels at runtime. Its CUDA toolkit, including `nvcc` and
headers, must match the selected CUDA major version. Set `CUDA_HOME` when the
toolkit is not discoverable automatically.

Verify the installation:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from importlib.metadata import version
import nccl.ep
import nccl.m2n

print(version("nccl-extensions"))
PY
```

See [`python/README.md`](python/README.md) for package layout, API usage, and
editable installation details.

## Building from source

This repo vendors NCCL as a git submodule. Clone with:

```bash
git clone --recursive <repo-url>
```

(or initialize and build the vendored NCCL after a normal clone):

```bash
make nccl-submodule
```

By default, NCCL keeps its native `third_party/nccl/build` output, while NCCL
EP and NCCL M2N place libraries under `build/lib` and headers under
`build/include` at the repository root.

Build either extension from the repository root. Both targets install their
artifacts into the shared build tree:

```bash
make nccl_ep.build   # build/{lib,include,...}
make nccl_m2n.build  # build/{lib,include,...}
```

Unless `NCCL_HOME` is set, plain `make` initializes and builds the vendored
NCCL before building both extension libraries. `make clean` cleans both
extensions without touching NCCL. Each library has an independent build-root
override, while `BUILDDIR` changes the shared default for both extensions:

```bash
make nccl-submodule NCCL_BUILDDIR=/path/to/nccl/build
make BUILDDIR=/path/to/extensions/build
make nccl_ep.build NCCL_EP_BUILDDIR=/path/to/nccl-ep/build
make nccl_m2n.build NCCL_M2N_BUILDDIR=/path/to/nccl-m2n/build
```

The root Makefile passes `NCCL_BUILDDIR` to NCCL as its native `BUILDDIR`
variable. See each subproject's README for library-specific build options.
