/*************************************************************************
 * Tensor Reshard — Split-Comm RING Path (QP-scalability optimization)
 *
 * For the RING algorithm under NODE_AWARE load balancing, the single
 * full all-to-all ncclDevComm spanning every trainer + generator rank
 * costs O(N^2) GIN queue pairs.  This module forms two narrower comms
 * instead:
 *
 *   commA (FULL all-to-all): trainer ranks + the entire FIRST generator
 *         NVL domain.  Carries the cross-group GIN puts (source ->
 *         first-domain leaders).
 *
 *   commB (RAIL only): ALL generator ranks.  Carries the intra-generator
 *         cross-NVL ring forwarding and the LSA fan-out.
 *
 * This is additive and non-destructive. PACK uses its legacy
 * node-aware admission; PIPE uses split comms for node-aware destination
 * replication. Both use the same split communicator construction and
 * forwarding path after admission.
 *
 * NOTE: the generator NVL-domain size (lsaSize) is topology dependent
 * and is only known after commB is formed and its DevComm is probed.
 * commA's membership (which generator ranks join) is therefore derived
 * AFTER commB exists; the probed lsaSize is broadcast across the parent
 * comm so trainer-only ranks (which are not in commB) agree on the
 * eligibility decision and commA membership.
